# Gas & energy estimation (MJ / Ft)

The system provides a practical way to track heating usage in **energy terms** and estimate cost.

## Inputs

Common configuration inputs (as seen in UI):
- Gas heating value (MJ)
- Price / cost parameter (Ft)

## Outputs (displayed)

The UI can show:
- MJ estimate
- m³ estimate
- cost estimate (Ft)
- daily heating cycles / heating time

> Exact calculation details depend on firmware implementation. This section documents what is shown in the UI and why it is useful.

## Why MJ (not only m³)

MJ better reflects usable energy and makes it easier to compare:
- different gas quality/heating value
- seasonal usage and building changes
