# Learning & diagnostics

The UI includes “learning diagnostics” elements that visualize:
- **heat‑up rate** (how quickly temperature rises when heating)
- **loss coefficient / efficiency** (how quickly the building cools down)

These values are displayed in the Diagnostics section and are used by features like pre‑heat.

## Learning slope

A “learning slope” value can be displayed and/or configured, describing the learned °C/hour behavior.

## What learning is used for

Typical uses:
- estimating how early to start heating for a schedule target (pre‑heat)
- providing stability (reducing overshoot) by understanding inertia

> This documentation stays focused on the features visible in the current UI/screens.
